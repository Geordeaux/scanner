description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when a GitHub audit log stream is modified (e.g. paused, enabled, or disabled). An adversary may attempt to interrupt audit logging to erase their tracks.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor for changes to audit log streaming configurations.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user.
  2. Verify if this was a planned infrastructure change.
  3. Restore the stream immediately.
