description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when an invitation to join a GitHub enterprise or organization is sent to a non-company email address. This rule can be customized to alert you when a GitHub invitation is sent to an unexpected domain i.e. not one of your company's domains used for email.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor for invitations sent to non-company domains.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the invited email and the inviter.
  2. Verify if the external collaboration is authorized.
  3. Revoke the invitation if unauthorized.
