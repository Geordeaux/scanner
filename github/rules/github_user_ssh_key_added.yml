name: GitHub User SSH Key Added
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when an SSH key is added to a user account.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GitHub audit logs for `public_key.create`. Adding an SSH key allows access to all repositories the user has permissions for.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the key fingerprint.
  2. Verify if the user added this key from a known device.
  3. Revoke the key immediately if unauthorized.
