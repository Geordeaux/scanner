name: GitHub User GPG Key Added
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when a GPG key is added to a user account.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GitHub audit logs for `gpg_key.create`. GPG keys are used to sign commits; an attacker could use a stolen or unauthorized key to sign malicious commits.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the key ID.
  2. Verify if the user added this key.
  3. Revoke the key immediately if unauthorized.
