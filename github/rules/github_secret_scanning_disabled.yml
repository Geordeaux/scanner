name: GitHub Secret Scanning Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when secret scanning is disabled for a repository.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GitHub audit logs for `repo.disable_secret_scanning`. Disabling this feature exposes the repository to the risk of committed credentials going unnoticed.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the repository and the user.
  2. Re-enable secret scanning immediately.
  3. Scan the repository history for any secrets committed while it was disabled.
