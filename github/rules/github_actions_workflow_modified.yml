name: GitHub Actions Workflow Modified
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects modifications to GitHub Actions workflow files.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GitHub audit logs for pushes to `.github/workflows/*.yml`. Attackers may modify workflows to inject malicious code into the build pipeline (supply chain attack).

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the repository and the user.
  2. Review the changes to the workflow file.
  3. Verify if the change was authorized and reviewed.
  4. Revert immediately if malicious.
