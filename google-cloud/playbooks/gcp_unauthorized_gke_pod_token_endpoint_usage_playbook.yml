name: Unauthorized GKE Pod Token Endpoint Usage Playbook
description: Alert when an authorization token likely originating from GKE activity is subsequently used within a command line on an endpoint system, suggesting potential credential exfiltration and reuse.
severity: Medium
steps:
- name: Investigation
  description: Monitor EDR/process telemetry for command lines that contain a Bearer token and appear to be accessing Kubernetes or GKE APIs (for example, kubernetes.default.svc or container.googleapis.com). This approximates the case where a GKE pod token is copied and then reused from an endpoint. Group by host, user, and command line to surface distinct uses.
- name: Triage
  description: '1. Identify the process, user, and host where the token was observed.

    2. Confirm if this was an authorized administrative action (for example, a kubeconfig or token being tested locally).

    3. If suspicious, search for related activity by the same user, host, and token (API calls, new credentials, privilege escalation).

    4. Rotate the affected Kubernetes service account tokens and investigate for further compromise.'
