name: GCP Multiple Secrets Deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when multiple secrets or secret versions are deleted from GCP Secret Manager. This behavior may indicate an attempt to compromise data integrity or availability, which could be malicious.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloud Audit Logs for DestroySecretVersion and DeleteSecret events. Detect if more than ten such events occur within a 1-hour window by the same user. Capture relevant details such as the event count, user information, and IP addresses involved, and set a high severity risk score to indicate the potential threat.

  ## Triage and Response
  Investigate the detected delete attempts to determine if they were authorized. Review the user and IP addresses involved to ensure that no unauthorized data destruction has occurred. Monitor for further suspicious activities involving this user or IP address.
