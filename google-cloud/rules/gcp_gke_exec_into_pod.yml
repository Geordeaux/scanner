name: GCP GKE Exec into Pod
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects execution of commands inside a GKE pod.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Kubernetes audit logs (via Cloud Audit Logs) for `pods/exec` calls. Attackers may use `kubectl exec` to run malicious commands inside containers.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the pod.
  2. Review the command executed.
  3. Terminate the pod and investigate the user if malicious.
