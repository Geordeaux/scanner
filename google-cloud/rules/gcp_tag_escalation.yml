  Detects a sequence of events that could indicate a privilege escalation attempt via GCP's tag-based access control. The sequence includes: 1. Enumeration of IAM policies and tags 2. Creation of a tag binding 3. Performance of a privileged operation


  ## Strategy
  Monitor logs for the specific sequence of events described.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the sequence of actions.
  2. Verify if the actions are authorized and business-justified.
  3. If unauthorized, revert changes and suspend the user.
