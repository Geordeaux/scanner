  ## Goal
  Detects downloads of attachments from Google Chat.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace Chat audit logs for `download_attachment`. Large volumes of downloads may indicate data exfiltration via Chat.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the file.
  2. Verify if the download is business-related.
  3. Investigate further if the file is sensitive.
