name: Google Workspace Gmail Delegation Granted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when a user grants Gmail access delegation to another account.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace Gmail audit logs for `grant_delegated_access`. Attackers use delegation to access mailboxes without needing the victim's credentials for every login, often bypassing MFA checks during access.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the delegator and the delegate.
  2. Verify if the delegation is business-justified (e.g., executive assistant).
  3. Remove the delegation and investigate the delegate account if unauthorized.
