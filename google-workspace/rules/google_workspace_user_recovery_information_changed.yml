name: Google Workspace User Recovery Information Changed
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects changes to a user's account recovery email or phone number.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace User audit logs for `change_recovery_email` or `change_recovery_phone`. Attackers modify this to maintain persistence and regain access if the password is reset.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user.
  2. Contact the user via an out-of-band method (e.g., Slack, Manager) to verify the change.
  3. Revert the change and reset credentials if unauthorized.
