name: Google Workspace Mass Drive Download
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects a high volume of file downloads from Google Drive by a single user.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace Drive audit logs for `download` events. A sudden spike in downloads may indicate data exfiltration.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the files downloaded.
  2. Verify if the activity is business-justified (e.g., backup, migration).
  3. Suspend the user and revoke access if exfiltration is suspected.
