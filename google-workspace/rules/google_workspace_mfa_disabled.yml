  Identifies when multi-factor authentication (MFA) is disabled for a Google Workspace organization. Security teams can monitor for changes to MFA configuration that may weaken the organization's security posture.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace audit logs for specific administrative or user actions.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the action.
  2. Verify if the action was authorized.
  3. If unauthorized, revert the change and reset user credentials.
