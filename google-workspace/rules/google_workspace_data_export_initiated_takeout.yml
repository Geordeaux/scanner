name: Google Workspace Data Export Initiated (Takeout)
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when a user initiates a Google Takeout data export.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace audit logs for `takeout_initiated`. Takeout allows users to export their entire Google account data, representing a significant exfiltration risk.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user.
  2. Verify if the export is authorized (e.g., departing employee).
  3. Suspend the user and cancel the export if unauthorized.
