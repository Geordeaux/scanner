name: Google Workspace Encryption Key File Accessed By An Anonymous User
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Identifies when an encryption key file is accessed by an anonymous user in Google Drive. An adversary may attempt to access encryption keys before moving laterally and compromising sensitive data.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor for mass downloads, deletions, or external sharing of files.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the files involved.
  2. Verify if the activity is business-justified.
  3. Revoke sharing or suspend the user if data exfiltration is suspected.
