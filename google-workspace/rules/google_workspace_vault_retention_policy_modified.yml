name: Google Workspace Vault Retention Policy Modified
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects changes to Google Vault retention policies.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Google Workspace Vault audit logs for `change_retention_policy`. Malicious actors may shorten retention periods to destroy evidence of their activities (Defense Evasion).

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the admin performing the change.
  2. Verify if the policy change was authorized by Legal/Compliance.
  3. Revert the policy immediately to preserve data if unauthorized.
