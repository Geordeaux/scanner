name: Atlassian Authentication Policy Updated
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects updates to authentication policies (e.g., SSO, MFA, IP allowlists).
  Weakening these policies can allow unauthorized access.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was authorized.
  2. Check if any logins occurred from previously blocked IPs.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`attributes.actor.email`) who updated the policy.
  2. Identify what changed (e.g., `ip_allowlist_disabled`).
  1. If unauthorized, revert the policy change immediately.
  2. Investigate the actor's account.
