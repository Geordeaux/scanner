name: Atlassian Jira New User Created
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a new user is created in Atlassian Jira.
  This can indicate potential persistence or unauthorized
  account creation.

  ## Strategy
  1. Verify if this was an authorized onboarding request.
  2. Check the email domain of the new user.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`attributes.actor.email`) who created the account.
  2. Identify the new user account.
  1. If unauthorized, suspend the new account.
  2. Investigate the creator's account.
