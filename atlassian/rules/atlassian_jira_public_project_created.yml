name: Atlassian Jira Public Project Created
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when a Jira project is created with public access (anonymous access allowed).
  Public projects expose internal data to the internet, leading to data leakage.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was authorized.
  2. Check if any sensitive data has already been added to the project.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`attributes.actor.email`) who created the project.
  2. Identify the project name and key.
  1. Immediately change the permission scheme to restrict access (remove anonymous access).
  2. If unauthorized, delete the project or archive it.
  3. Educate the user on data security policies.
