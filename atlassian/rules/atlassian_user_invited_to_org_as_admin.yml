name: Atlassian User Invited to Organization as Admin
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an Atlassian user is invited to the organization with the organizational
  administrator role. An attacker may attempt to invite additional identities to the
  organization with administrative privileges.

  ## Strategy
  1. Confirm if this was authorized.
  2. Check if the invitee is internal or external.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`attributes.actor.email`) who sent the invitation.
  2. Identify the invitee.
  1. If unauthorized, revoke the invitation immediately.
  2. Investigate the actor's account.
