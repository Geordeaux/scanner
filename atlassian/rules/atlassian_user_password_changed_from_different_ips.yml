name: Atlassian Jira User Password Changed From Different IPs
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user's password is changed from different IP addresses in Atlassian
  Jira. This can indicate potential persistence or account compromise.

  ## Strategy
  1. Contact the user to verify if they performed these actions.
  2. Check for other suspicious activity from these IPs.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`attributes.actor.email`).
  2. Analyze the IP addresses involved (geolocation, reputation).
  1. If unauthorized, reset the user's password immediately.
  2. Revoke active sessions.
  3. Block the malicious IPs.
