name: Atlassian Jira Bulk Issue Export
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when a bulk issue export is performed in Jira.
  This can indicate exfiltration of sensitive project data.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was authorized.
  2. Check if the user normally performs this action.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`attributes.actor.email`) who performed the export.
  2. Identify the project and number of issues exported.
  1. If unauthorized, investigate the user's device for exfiltrated data.
  2. Review the user's permissions.
