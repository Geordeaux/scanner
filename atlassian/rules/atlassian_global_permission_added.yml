name: Atlassian Jira Global Permission Added
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when global permission is added in Atlassian Jira.
  This can indicate potential privilege escalation or unauthorized
  administrative changes.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this change was authorized via change management.
  2. Verify the necessity of the permission.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`attributes.actor.email`) who added the permission.
  2. Identify the permission added and the target group/user.
  1. If unauthorized, revert the permission change.
  2. Investigate the actor's account.
