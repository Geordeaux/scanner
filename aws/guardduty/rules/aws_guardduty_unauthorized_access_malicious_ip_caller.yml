name: AWS GuardDuty Unauthorized Access Malicious IP Caller
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when an EC2 instance is communicating with a known malicious IP address.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GuardDuty findings for `UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/MaliciousIPCaller.Custom` or `UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/MaliciousIPCaller`. These indicate that an EC2 instance is communicating with an IP address included in a threat intelligence list.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the instance and the malicious IP.
  2. Check the direction of traffic (inbound/outbound).
  3. If outbound, the instance may be compromised and calling home.
  4. Isolate the instance and investigate running processes.
