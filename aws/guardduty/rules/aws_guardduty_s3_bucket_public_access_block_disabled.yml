name: AWS GuardDuty S3 Bucket Public Access Block Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when the S3 Block Public Access setting is disabled for a bucket.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GuardDuty findings for `Policy:S3/BucketPublicAccessBlock`. Disabling this setting can expose the bucket to the public internet.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the bucket and the user who modified the setting.
  2. Verify if public access is required for this bucket.
  3. If not, re-enable Block Public Access immediately.
  4. Check bucket logs for any unauthorized access during the exposure window.
