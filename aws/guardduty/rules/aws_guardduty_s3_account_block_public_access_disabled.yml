name: AWS GuardDuty S3 Account Block Public Access Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when the S3 Block Public Access setting is disabled at the account level.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GuardDuty findings for `Policy:S3/AccountPublicAccessBlock`. Disabling this setting removes the centralized guardrail against public buckets, potentially exposing all buckets in the account.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user who modified the account setting.
  2. Re-enable Block Public Access immediately.
  3. Investigate why the setting was disabled and if any buckets were made public during the exposure window.
