name: AWS GuardDuty IAM User Tor Access
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects AWS API calls made by an IAM user from a Tor exit node.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GuardDuty findings for `UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/TorIPCaller`. Accessing AWS APIs via Tor is highly suspicious and often indicates compromised credentials.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the IAM user.
  2. Confirm if the user has a legitimate reason to use Tor (unlikely).
  3. Revoke the user's credentials immediately.
  4. Audit all actions taken by this user.
