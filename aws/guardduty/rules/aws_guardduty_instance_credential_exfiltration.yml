name: AWS GuardDuty Instance Credential Exfiltration
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when temporary AWS credentials created for an EC2 instance are used from an external IP address.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor GuardDuty findings for `UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration`. This finding is triggered when instance profile credentials are used from an IP address other than the EC2 instance they were issued to.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Confirm if the IP address belongs to a legitimate user or system (e.g., a developer testing locally).
  2. If unauthorized, this confirms the instance credentials have been stolen.
  3. Revoke the credentials immediately.
  4. Investigate how the credentials were stolen (SSRF, RCE, etc.).
