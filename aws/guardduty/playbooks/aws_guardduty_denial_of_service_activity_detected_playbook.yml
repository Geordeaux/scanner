    ## Triage and response

    * Investigate the detected DoS activity to determine if it was authorized or expected (for example, controlled load testing).

    * Review the affected instance, security groups, and network paths for evidence of abuse or misconfiguration.

    * Correlate with other GuardDuty findings, VPC Flow Logs, and WAF / load balancer logs for related activity.

    * If malicious, isolate the instance or workload, block offending IPs or ranges, and consider implementing rate limiting and additional protections.'
