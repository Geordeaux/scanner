  mechanisms and forensic visibility.
severity: High
steps:
- name: Investigation
  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `logs.amazonaws.com`
    with:

    * `eventName="DeleteLogGroup"`


    Focus on successful deletions of log groups that are expected to be long-lived
    or attached to critical workloads, security tooling, or compliance-related logging.'
- name: Triage
  description: '* Confirm whether the deleted log group is associated with critical
    workloads (e.g. security services, production systems, audit logs).

    * Validate that the deletion aligns with an approved change request or maintenance
    window.

    * Review recent activity from the same principal and source IP for related attempts
    to weaken logging or monitoring (e.g. CloudTrail, Config, security tool logs).

    * If unapproved, treat as a high-priority event: preserve evidence, assess potential
    impact on visibility, and restore or recreate required logging configurations.'
