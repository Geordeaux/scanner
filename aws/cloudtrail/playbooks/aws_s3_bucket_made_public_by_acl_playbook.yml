name: AWS S3 Bucket Made Public By ACL Playbook
description: Detect when an Amazon S3 bucket is made publicly accessible via Access
  Control Lists (ACL). This could indicate an attempt to expose sensitive data or
  impair defenses by making the bucket open to unauthorized users.
severity: High

- name: Investigation
  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `s3.amazonaws.com` for:

    * `PutBucketAcl`


    and identify events where the ACL grants access to either of the global groups:

    * `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers`

    * `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers`


    These grant URIs indicate that the bucket ACL allows access to a broad or public
    audience, which may expose sensitive data.'
- name: Triage
  description: '* Confirm whether the bucket was intentionally made public (for example,
    a static website or public data set) or if this was accidental/malicious.

    * Identify the affected bucket and review the data it contains for sensitivity
    (PII, credentials, financial data, etc.).

    * If unapproved, immediately remediate by tightening the ACL and/or using S3 Block
    Public Access controls.

    * Review other configuration changes and access patterns involving the same bucket
    and principal for additional misconfiguration or data exposure.'
