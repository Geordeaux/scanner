  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from:

    * `eventSource: "access-analyzer.amazonaws.com"`

    * `eventName: "DeleteAnalyzer"`


    Any successful `DeleteAnalyzer` call should be treated as a notable event, as
    it removes an analyser that can surface cross-account and external access risks.'

  description: "* Identify which account and region the analyser belonged to, and\
    \ which principal performed the deletion.\n* Confirm whether there is an approved\
    \ change request or maintenance activity covering the deletion.\n* Check whether\
    \ other security or logging controls (for example, GuardDuty, Config, CloudTrail)\
    \ have also been modified in the same time window.\n* If the action is not clearly\
    \ authorised:\n  * Treat as a potential defence-evasion attempt.\n  * Review recent\
    \ IAM activity by the same principal and IP address (role changes, policy updates,\
    \ key creation, and so on).\n  * Consider restoring or recreating the analyser\
    \ and tightening permissions around `access-analyzer.amazonaws.com`.\n  * Escalate\
    \ to incident response for further investigation."
