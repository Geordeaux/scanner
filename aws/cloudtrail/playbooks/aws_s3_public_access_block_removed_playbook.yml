  description: '* Confirm whether relaxing or removing Public Access Block is part
    of an approved change (for example, a temporary test bucket).

    * Identify all affected accounts/buckets and review their contents for sensitivity
    and exposure risk.

    * If unapproved, immediately re-enable strict Public Access Block and consider
    enabling S3 Block Public Access at the org/root account level.

    * Review other recent configuration changes and access by the same principal for
    additional misconfigurations or malicious activity.'
