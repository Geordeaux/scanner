- name: Investigation
  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `ec2.amazonaws.com`
    with:

    * `eventName="DeleteFlowLogs"`


    Focus on successful deletions of flow logs associated with production VPCs, internet-facing
    workloads, or security monitoring.'
- name: Triage
  description: '* Identify which VPCs, subnets, or network interfaces were covered
    by the deleted flow logs.

    * Confirm whether the deletion aligns with an approved change request or maintenance
    activity.

    * Review recent activity from the same principal and source IP for related attempts
    to weaken logging (e.g. CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs, Config).

    * If unapproved, treat as a high-priority event: preserve evidence, assess the
    impact on network visibility, and reinstate required VPC Flow Logs.'
