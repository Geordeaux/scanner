name: AWS Console Login Without MFA Playbook
description: Detect AWS Management Console logins where Multi-Factor Authentication
  (MFA) was not used. This highlights interactive access relying solely on username
  and password, increasing the risk of unauthorised access.

  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `signin.amazonaws.com`
    with:

    * `eventName="ConsoleLogin"`

    * `responseElements.ConsoleLogin="Success"`

    * `additionalEventData.MFAUsed="No"`


    This captures successful console logins that did not use MFA (for both IAM users
    and, critically, the root account).'

  description: "* Confirm whether the account is expected to be able to log in without\
    \ MFA (for most organisations this should be \u201Cno\u201D, especially for root\
    \ and privileged users).\n* Review the user\u2019s role and privileges; prioritise\
    \ investigation of administrative or break-glass accounts.\n* Correlate with recent\
    \ activity from the same principal and source IP for signs of suspicious behaviour\
    \ (policy changes, key creation, logging changes, etc.).\n* If the login is not\
    \ explicitly approved, require MFA enrolment or disable console access for the\
    \ user, depending on policy.\n* For root logins without MFA, treat as a high-priority\
    \ issue and enforce immediate hardening (MFA, access key review, password rotation,\
    \ and broader compromise assessment)."
