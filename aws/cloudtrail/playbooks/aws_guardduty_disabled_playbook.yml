name: AWS GuardDuty Disabled Playbook
description: Detects when an Amazon GuardDuty detector is disabled or deleted. This
  may indicate an attempt to impair defences by turning off threat detection and monitoring.
severity: High
steps:
- name: Investigation
  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `guardduty.amazonaws.com`
    and alert on:

    * `DeleteDetector` events, or

    * `UpdateDetector` events where the detector is explicitly disabled (for example,
    `enable=false` in the request parameters).


    These actions should be rare, tightly controlled, and usually associated with
    planned maintenance or onboarding/offsboarding workflows. Any unplanned change
    warrants investigation.'
- name: Triage
  description: "* Identify who initiated the change (IAM user or role), from where\
    \ (IP, user agent), and in which account and region.\n* Confirm there is an approved\
    \ change, maintenance window, or documented migration that explains disabling\
    \ or deleting GuardDuty.\n* If there is no valid justification:\n  * Treat as\
    \ a high-severity incident (potential defence evasion).\n  * Immediately re-enable\
    \ GuardDuty (or recreate the detector) where appropriate.\n  * Review other recent\
    \ CloudTrail activity for the same principal and account (especially around IAM,\
    \ CloudTrail, Config, logging, and network controls).\n  * Escalate according\
    \ to the incident response process."
