description: "Detects excessive successful discovery-style API calls (for example,\
  \ `Describe`, `List`, `Get`) from a single IAM user within a short timeframe. This\
  \ can indicate reconnaissance as part of an attacker\u2019s attempt to understand\

  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events and identify IAM users that
    perform a burst of discovery-related API calls:

    * API operation name starting with `Describe`, `List`, or `Get`.

    * Requests that complete successfully (no `errorCode`).


    Over a five-minute window, count events per IAM user and alert when the number
    of successful discovery calls exceeds a chosen threshold (for example, 10+).'

  description: "* Identify the IAM user, originating IP, and user agent.\n* Determine\
    \ whether the behaviour aligns with:\n  * Known automation (for example, inventory\
    \ jobs, backup tooling, or deployment scripts), or\n  * Anomalous, ad-hoc activity\
    \ from consoles or unfamiliar hosts.\n* Review recent authentication activity\
    \ and role usage for the same identity.\n* If the activity is unapproved or unexpected:\n\
    \  * Treat as potential reconnaissance.\n  * Review additional actions performed\
    \ by the user around the same time (for example, write or privilege-escalation\
    \ APIs).\n  * Consider temporary access restriction and escalate per your incident\
    \ response process."
