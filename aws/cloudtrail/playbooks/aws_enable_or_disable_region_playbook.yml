  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `account.amazonaws.com`
    for:

    * `EnableRegion`

    * `DisableRegion`


    Region state changes can:

    * Introduce new, unmonitored attack surface (previously disabled regions).

    * Disrupt services and monitoring if regions are disabled unexpectedly.

    * Be used to route attacker activity into less visible regions.'

  description: "* Identify who initiated the change (principal, role, source IP, console\
    \ vs API).\n* Confirm there is an approved change (for example, change ticket,\
    \ deployment plan, or documented regional expansion).\n* Validate whether the\
    \ affected region is expected to be in use and that required controls (CloudTrail,\
    \ Config, GuardDuty, security tooling) are enabled there.\n* If the action is\
    \ unapproved or suspicious:\n  * Treat as potential account compromise.\n  * Verify\
    \ controls in all active regions (logging, detection, guardrails).\n  * Escalate\
    \ according to your incident response process."
