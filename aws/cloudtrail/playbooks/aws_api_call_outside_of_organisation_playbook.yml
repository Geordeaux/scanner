- name: Investigation
  description: Monitor AWS CloudTrail events and flag any API activity where the `recipientAccountId`
    (or equivalent account identifier) does not match a known, approved AWS account
    ID. This helps identify API calls originating from unmanaged, misconfigured, or
    potentially compromised accounts outside the organisation boundary.
- name: Triage
  description: '* Validate whether the account ID is truly unknown or has recently
    been on-boarded but not yet added to the approved list.

    * Confirm with the cloud/platform team whether the activity relates to legitimate
    testing, third-party services, or partner accounts.

    * If the account is confirmed as unauthorised, treat the activity as a potential
    compromise or misconfiguration and initiate the appropriate incident response
    playbook.


    Note: Update the list of approved AWS account IDs in the query before enabling
    this rule.'
