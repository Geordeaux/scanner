name: AWS Config Service Modified Playbook
description: Detect when AWS Config recorders or delivery channels are stopped, deleted,
  or modified. These actions may indicate an attempt to disable or impair configuration
  auditing and security monitoring.
severity: High
steps:
- name: Investigation
  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `config.amazonaws.com`
    for:

    * `StopConfigurationRecorder`

    * `DeleteConfigurationRecorder`

    * `DeleteDeliveryChannel`

    * `PutDeliveryChannel`

    * `PutConfigurationRecorder`


    These changes may be:

    * Legitimate configuration maintenance, or

    * Malicious attempts to tamper with AWS Config so that future changes are no longer
    recorded or delivered.'
- name: Triage
  description: '* Confirm whether the change aligns with an approved change request
    or maintenance window.

    * Validate that the initiating principal is authorised to administer AWS Config
    at the account and/or organisation level.

    * Review the before/after state of the recorder and delivery channel (status,
    included resources, global resources, SNS/S3 destinations, encryption configuration).

    * Investigate other recent activity from the same principal and source IP for
    signs of broader compromise.

    * If unauthorised or suspicious, treat as a high-severity incident: restore known-good
    AWS Config settings, constrain affected credentials, and perform a wider compromise
    assessment.'
