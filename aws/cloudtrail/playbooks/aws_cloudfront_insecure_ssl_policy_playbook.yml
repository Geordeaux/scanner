name: AWS CloudFront Insecure SSL Policy Playbook
description: Detect when an insecure SSL/TLS policy is configured for an AWS CloudFront
  distribution.
severity: Low
steps:
- name: Investigation
  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `cloudfront.amazonaws.com`
    for:

    * `CreateDistribution`

    * `UpdateDistribution`


    and identify distributions where `viewerCertificate.minimumProtocolVersion` is
    set to an insecure or legacy value such as:

    * `TLSv1`

    * `SSLv3`

    * `TLSv1_2016`

    * `TLSv1.1_2016`


    These configurations weaken transport security and may be used by an attacker
    (or misinformed operator) to downgrade TLS protections.'

  description: '* Validate whether the protocol downgrade aligns with an approved
    change request or legacy compatibility requirement.

    * Confirm the initiating principal is authorised to modify CloudFront distributions
    for the affected account.

    * If unapproved or unnecessary, plan remediation to move the distribution to a
    modern TLS policy (for example `TLSv1.2_2018` or later).

    * Review other recent changes by the same principal and to the same distribution
    for additional misconfigurations or malicious activity.'
