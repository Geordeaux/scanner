description: Detect configuration of insecure SSL policies on AWS Application Load
  Balancers (ALBs).
severity: Low
steps:
- name: Investigation
  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events for:

    * `ModifyListener`

    * `CreateListener`


    where the `requestParameters.sslPolicy` is set to one of a set of known weak or
    legacy SSL policies. These configurations may:

    * Permit deprecated ciphers or protocol versions, or

    * Degrade the overall cryptographic strength of TLS connections terminated at
    the ALB.'
- name: Triage
  description: '* Confirm whether the SSL policy change was requested as part of a
    documented change or rollback.

    * Validate that the chosen SSL policy aligns with internal cryptographic standards
    and regulatory requirements.

    * Where unjustified, plan a change to update the listener to a modern, secure
    TLS policy and assess whether any sensitive data may have been exposed under weaker
    settings.'
