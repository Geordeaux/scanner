name: AWS GuardDuty Publishing Destination Deleted Playbook
description: Detects when an Amazon GuardDuty detector's publishing destination is
  deleted. This prevents exporting of GuardDuty findings and may indicate an attempt
  to impair defences by disabling downstream monitoring, alerting, or archival.
severity: High

- name: Investigation
  description: 'Monitor AWS CloudTrail management events from `guardduty.amazonaws.com`
    and alert on:

    * `DeletePublishingDestination` events for any GuardDuty detector.


    These actions should be rare, tightly controlled, and usually associated with
    planned changes to central logging or SIEM integrations. Any unplanned change
    warrants immediate investigation.'

  description: "* Identify who initiated the change (IAM user or role), from where\
    \ (IP, user agent), and in which account and region.\n* Confirm there is an approved\
    \ change, maintenance window, or documented migration that explains deletion of\
    \ the publishing destination.\n* If there is no valid justification:\n  * Treat\
    \ as a high-severity incident (potential defence evasion / logging impairment).\n\
    \  * Confirm whether GuardDuty findings are still being exported elsewhere (S3,\
    \ EventBridge, SIEM).\n  * Recreate or restore the publishing destination as appropriate.\n\
    \  * Review recent CloudTrail activity for the same principal and account (especially\
    \ GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Config, IAM, logging, and network controls).\n  * Escalate\
    \ according to the incident response process."
