name: StopInstance FOLLOWED BY ModifyInstanceAttributes
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Identifies when StopInstance and ModifyInstanceAttributes CloudTrail events occur in a short period of time. Since EC2 startup scripts cannot be modified without first stopping the instance, StopInstances should be a signal.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor logs for the specific sequence of events described.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the sequence of actions.
  2. Verify if the actions are authorized and business-justified.
  3. If unauthorized, revert changes and suspend the user.
