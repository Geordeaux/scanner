name: SSM Rare SendCommand Code Execution by EC2 Instance
enabled: true
severity: Medium
description: |-
  ## Goal
  This hunting query identifies when a single `SendCommand` API call is made by an EC2 instance to execute a command via the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) service within the last 7 days. The `SendCommand` API call allows users to remotely execute commands on EC2 instances. Default documents like `AWS-RunPowerShellScript` and `AWS-RunShellScript` are commonly used for this purpose. Adversaries may abuse this API to execute arbitrary commands on compromised EC2 instances.
