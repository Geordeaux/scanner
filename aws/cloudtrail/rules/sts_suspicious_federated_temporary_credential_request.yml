  ## Goal
  This hunting query identifies when a user requests temporary federated credentials with a duration greater than 24 hours or with the `AdministratorAccess` policy attached. Federated users are typically given temporary credentials to access AWS services. A duration greater than 24 hours or the `AdministratorAccess` policy attached may indicate an adversary attempting to maintain access to AWS services for an extended period of time or escalate privileges.
