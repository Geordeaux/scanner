name: AWS EFS Fileshare Modified or Deleted
description: |-
  Detects when a EFS Fileshare is modified or deleted.
  You can't delete a file system that is in use.
  If the file system has any mount targets, the adversary must first delete them, so deletion of a mount will occur before deletion of a fileshare.
