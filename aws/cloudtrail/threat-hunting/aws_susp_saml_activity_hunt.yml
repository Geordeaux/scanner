name: AWS Suspicious SAML Activity
description: |-
  Identifies when suspicious SAML activity has occurred in AWS. An adversary could gain backdoor access via SAML.

  References:
  * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateSAMLProvider.html
  * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithSAML.html

  False Positives:
  * Automated processes that uses Terraform may lead to false positives.
  * SAML Provider could be updated by a system administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.
  * SAML Provider being updated from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
