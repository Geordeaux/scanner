name: Cloudflare Tunnel Deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects the deletion of a Cloudflare Tunnel.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs for `tunnel_delete`. Deleting a tunnel can cause an immediate outage for hybrid/on-prem resources.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the tunnel and the user.
  2. Verify if this was a planned decommissioning.
  3. If accidental/malicious, restore the tunnel configuration.
