name: Cloudflare Worker Script Modified
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects modifications to a Cloudflare Worker script.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs for `worker_script_update`. Malicious changes to workers can intercept traffic, steal data, or serve malware.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the worker and the user.
  2. Review the code changes.
  3. Revert to a previous version if malicious code is found.
