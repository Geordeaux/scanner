name: Cloudflare Registrar Transfer Lock Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when the domain transfer lock is disabled.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs. Disabling the lock allows the domain to be transferred to another registrar (hijacking).

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the domain and the user.
  2. Re-enable the lock immediately.
  3. Investigate if a transfer code was requested.
