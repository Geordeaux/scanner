name: Cloudflare Unexpected Client Request
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect GET requests to URIs that are commonly targeted by attackers,
  such as admin panels, configuration files, and system files.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare logs for this specific threat type. Correlate with origin server logs.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Validate the finding in the Cloudflare dashboard.
  2. Identify the source IP and user agent.
  3. Check if the request was blocked or allowed.
  4. If allowed and malicious, update WAF rules to block.
