name: Cloudflare Under Attack Mode Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when 'Under Attack Mode' is disabled.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs. If this mode was enabled during an active attack, disabling it prematurely could expose the origin.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Confirm if the attack has subsided.
  2. If not, re-enable Under Attack Mode.
