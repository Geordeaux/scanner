name: Cloudflare SSL/TLS Encryption Mode Downgraded
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when the SSL/TLS encryption mode is downgraded (e.g., to Flexible or Off).

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs for changes to the `ssl` setting. Downgrading exposes traffic between Cloudflare and the origin to interception.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the new mode.
  2. Revert to Full (Strict) immediately.
  3. Investigate the change.
