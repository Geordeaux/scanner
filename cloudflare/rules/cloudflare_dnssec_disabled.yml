name: Cloudflare DNSSEC Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when DNSSEC is disabled for a zone.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs for `zone_setting_edit` where DNSSEC is turned off. This removes cryptographic integrity from DNS records.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user.
  2. Re-enable DNSSEC immediately.
  3. Investigate why it was disabled.
