name: Cloudflare Security Level Lowered
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when the Cloudflare Security Level is lowered (e.g., from 'High' to 'Essentially Off').

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs for changes to the `security_level` setting.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user and the new level.
  2. If unauthorized, restore the previous security level.
  3. Investigate why the protection was lowered.
