name: Cloudflare Global API Key Viewed
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when a user views their Global API Key.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs for `user_view_api_key`. The Global API Key has full access to the account and should rarely be viewed or used.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user.
  2. Confirm if they needed the key for a legitimate integration.
  3. Recommend using API Tokens with scoped permissions instead.
