name: Cloudflare Empty User Agent
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect HTTP requests that have an empty or missing User-Agent header,
  which can indicate automated attacks, bots, or malicious scanning activity.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare logs for this specific threat type. Correlate with origin server logs.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Validate the finding in the Cloudflare dashboard.
  2. Identify the source IP and user agent.
  3. Check if the request was blocked or allowed.
  4. If allowed and malicious, update WAF rules to block.
