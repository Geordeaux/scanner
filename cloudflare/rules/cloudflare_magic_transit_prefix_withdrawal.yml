name: Cloudflare Magic Transit Prefix Withdrawal
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when a BGP prefix is withdrawn from Magic Transit.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Cloudflare Audit Logs. Withdrawing a prefix stops Cloudflare from advertising it, potentially exposing the network to DDoS or hijacking.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the prefix and the user.
  2. Verify if this was a planned maintenance.
  3. Re-advertise the prefix if unauthorized.
