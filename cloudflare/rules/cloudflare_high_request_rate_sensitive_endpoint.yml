name: Cloudflare High Request Rate to Sensitive Endpoint
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects high request rates to sensitive endpoints (e.g., admin panels).

  ## Strategy
  Monitor for spikes in traffic to paths like `/admin`, `/api/admin`, etc.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the source IP and path.
  2. Verify if the traffic is legitimate (e.g., admin activity).
  3. If not, block the IP and investigate intent.
