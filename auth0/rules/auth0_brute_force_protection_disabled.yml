name: Auth0 brute-force protection disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when brute-force protection in Auth0 is disabled.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was an authorized change.
  2. Contact the application owner or tenant admin.
  3. Check if other security settings were disabled.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the client ID (`data.client_id`) and user (`data.user_id`) responsible.
  2. Check the timestamp and source IP.
  1. If unauthorized, re-enable brute force protection immediately.
  2. Investigate the user account that performed the action.
  3. Review logs for any brute force attacks that occurred while protection was disabled.
