name: Auth0 CIC Credential Stuffing
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect credential stuffing attacks targeting Auth0's cross-origin authentication
  feature in Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) by monitoring for the following events:
  * `scoa` - Successful cross-origin authentication
  * `fcoa` - Failed cross-origin authentication
  * `pwd_leak` - Someone attempted to login with a breached password

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if the traffic matches known botnet patterns.
  2. Check if the targeted users have been compromised (successful logins).

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the source IPs and targeted users.
  2. Check for successful cross-origin authentications (`scoa`) or breached password logins (`pwd_leak`).
  1. Block the attacking IPs.
  2. Reset passwords for any users with successful logins or `pwd_leak` events.
  3. Enable or enforce MFA for affected users.
