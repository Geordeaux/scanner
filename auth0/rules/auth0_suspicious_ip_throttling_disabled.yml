name: Auth0 suspicious IP throttling disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when suspicious IP throttling is disabled in Auth0.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was authorized.
  2. Check if other security settings were disabled.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the client ID (`data.client_id`) and user (`data.user_id`) responsible.
  2. Check the timestamp and source IP.
  1. If unauthorized, re-enable throttling immediately.
  2. Investigate the user account.
  3. Review logs for high-velocity attacks during the disabled window.
