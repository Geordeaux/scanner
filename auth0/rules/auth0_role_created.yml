name: Auth0 Role Created
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a role is created in Auth0. Roles can be used to grant
  specific permissions and should be monitored for potential privilege
  escalation.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was authorized.
  2. Review the permissions assigned to the new role.
  3. Check who was assigned to this role (if anyone).

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`data.user_id`) who created the role.
  2. Check the timestamp.
  1. If unauthorized, delete the role immediately.
  2. Investigate the user account.
  3. Audit other roles created by this user.
