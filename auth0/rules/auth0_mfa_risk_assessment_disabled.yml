name: Auth0 MFA Risk Assessment Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when MFA risk assessment is disabled in Auth0. This can weaken
  security controls by reducing adaptive authentication capabilities.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was authorized.
  2. Check if other security settings were modified.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`data.user_id`) who disabled the setting.
  2. Check the timestamp and source IP.
  1. If unauthorized, re-enable risk assessment immediately.
  2. Investigate the user account.
  3. Review logins that occurred while the setting was disabled.
