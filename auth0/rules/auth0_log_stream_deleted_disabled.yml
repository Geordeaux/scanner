name: Auth0 Log Stream Deleted or Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when an Auth0 log stream is deleted or disabled. Attackers may disable
  logging to evade detection and hide their activities.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was authorized.
  2. Check if other logging mechanisms are still active.
  3. Investigate actions performed after the log stream was disabled.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`data.user_id`) and the log stream affected.
  2. Check the timestamp and source IP.
  1. If unauthorized, re-enable the log stream immediately.
  2. Investigate the user account.
  3. Review logs from other sources (if available) to fill the gap.
