name: Auth0 MFA Policy Disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when MFA policies are disabled in Auth0. This can weaken
  security controls and should be monitored closely.

  ## Strategy
  1. Determine if this was authorized.
  2. Check if any high-risk users logged in without MFA shortly after.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user (`data.user_id`) who disabled the policy.
  2. Check the timestamp and source IP.
  1. If unauthorized, re-enable the MFA policy immediately.
  2. Investigate the user account.
  3. Enforce MFA for all users and review recent logins.
